## Issues Faced and Solutions
During the development process, I encountered a few challenges that were resolved through trial and error. As I aimed to maintain simplicity while ensuring adherence to the instructions, my focus was on testing and verifying that the deployed site met the specified criteria. I had alot of trouble keeping the image gallery symetrical and fit only in the gallery section I solved this from watching countless youtube videos and learning about max width and height which is linked above. The anchor links were also hard to work with along with some issues I had implementing loops & conditionals I used my previous assignments to help me with that. The attributes I linked above worked like charms after hours of playing around with code. Along the way I had a checklist and a rough draft on figjam of all the requirements this assignment is looking for and in the end I checked off all requirements. Overall I feel confident with the end result and feel I implemented minimal styling to create a full html web page my main focus was to create interactive content with toggles like the assignment asked, and I feel I made it work great.
